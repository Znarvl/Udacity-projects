## description
This is my 3rd project on the google front end project. This is a simple frogger look-alike arcade Game
We used the app.js file to modify and using our object oriented skills to make it work!
Enjoy


## howtp
Open the index.html file to open the game in your  browser


You are using the key arrows to move up, down and sideways to controll your player
The goal is to move to the water, when you succeed the game will reset to origin
Watch out for the bugs, you can not touch them because it will reset the game!
