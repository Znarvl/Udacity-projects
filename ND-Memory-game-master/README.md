## description
This is the second project of the Udacity FEND program. I've done a barebone model that udacity provided us. Then added some extra css code to make it more "me".

The game is based around 16 cards with the front up side down, there are pair of 2 and you need them to match, by clicking on the cards you find different cards underneath and when you find both pair they will match and you need to find the next one, up to when all 8 cards are found, the game will end and you will be given a time, star rating and moves. Enjoy!
